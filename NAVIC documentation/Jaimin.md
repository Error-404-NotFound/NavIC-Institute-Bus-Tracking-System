 # NavIC

NavIC, which stands for Navigation with Indian Constellation, is the regional satellite navigation system developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is India's own navigation system, similar to the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States, GLONASS of Russia, and others. NavIC provides accurate positioning and timing information over India and the surrounding region, with a primary focus on the Indian subcontinent.

The constellation consists of 7 satellites. Three of the seven satellites are located in geostationary orbit (GEO) at longitudes 32.5° E, 83° E, and 131.5° E, approximately 36,000 km (22,000 mi) above Earth's surface. The remaining four satellites are in inclined geosynchronous orbit (GSO). Two of them cross the equator at 55° E and two at 111.75° E.

NavIC is compatible with GPS and can be used in conjunction with it to improve overall accuracy and reliability for users in the region. It plays a crucial role in various sectors, including transportation, agriculture, surveying, and military applications, among others.

# Navic use in Bus Tracking 

1. Accuracy: NavIC can provide position accuracy of better than 20 meters, which is sufficient for most bus tracking applications.
   
 2.Reliability: NavIC is a self-sufficient system that does not rely on any foreign infrastructure. This makes it more reliable than other navigation systems that  
 may be affected by geopolitical issues.

3. Cost-effectiveness: NavIC-based bus tracking systems are relatively cost-effective to implement and operate.

4. Driver safety monitoring: NavIC can be used to track the driving behavior of bus drivers and identify any unsafe practices, such as speeding or harsh braking. This can help to improve the safety of bus passengers and other road users.

5. Fleet management: NavIC can be used to track the location and status of all buses in a fleet in real time. This information can be used to optimize bus schedules, reduce fuel consumption, and improve maintenance planning.

6. Passenger information: NavIC can be used to provide passengers with real-time information on the location of their bus, its estimated arrival time, and any disruptions to the service. This can help passengers to plan their journey and avoid delays.

7. Emergency management: NavIC can be used to track the location of buses during emergencies, such as natural disasters or accidents. This information can be used to coordinate relief and rescue operations.

# Implementation of NavIC in software develpment

Below is a example code of accessing navic data using pythin library called pyNavIC:
```python
# generated with the help of AI
import pyNavIC

def main():
    try:
        # Initialize the NavIC receiver
        receiver = pyNavIC.NavICReceiver()

        # Get the current location data
        location_data = receiver.get_location_data()

        # Print the latitude and longitude
        print(f"Latitude: {location_data.latitude}")
        print(f"Longitude: {location_data.longitude}")

        # You can access more information from location_data such as altitude, speed, etc.

    except pyNavIC.NavICError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
  if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
