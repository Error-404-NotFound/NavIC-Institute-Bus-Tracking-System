Problem Statement:
Design a Bus Tracking system for IIT Tirupati which provides user with the following specification(these are useful but you are encouraged to add more):
1)User should be able to map its present location and destination in the campus 
2)It should map the nearest bus location and its route, to the destination mapped
3)It would be nice if you are able to type your destination and get the bus number which is on its way / scheduled to be deployed for that final location.


Hard mode:
4)The  Estimated time of arrival , and would it be optimal to walk or wait for the bus.
